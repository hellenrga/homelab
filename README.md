# üè† Homelab

This repository contains the configuration and documentation of my homelab, which is built on a virtual machine (VM) to serve as a learning environment for exploring new technologies. As an Azure-focused engineer, I aim to leverage my experience with cloud platforms while expanding my knowledge.

The purpose of this homelab is not just to learn, but to apply best practices in infrastructure management, security, scalability, and deployment workflows. By documenting my journey, I hope to share insights with others while maintaining transparency about my progress.

You can track all my efforts and detailed write-ups on my personal website: [hellendev.com.br](https://hellendev.com.br).

## Principles

Several principles guide my approach to building and maintaining this homelab:

- **Azure-Centric Approach**: As I work with Azure daily, I integrate Azure solutions into my learning and configurations wherever possible.
- **Focus on Cloud-Native Practices**: Tools like Kubernetes, Docker, and GitOps are at the core of my learning objectives.
- **Declarative Management**: All configurations are managed through GitOps for version control, transparency, and consistency.
- **Best Practices**: I adopt best practices in deployment, security, and infrastructure automation.
- **Documentation and Sharing**: Insights and learnings are meticulously documented, both in this repository and on [hellendev.com.br](https://hellendev.com.br).

## Cluster Setup

Although this homelab primarily runs on a VM, the configurations and tools used simulate real-world cloud environments. I plan to explore various technologies and workflows, including:

- **Kubernetes**: Managing and orchestrating containerized workloads.
- **Docker**: Building, deploying, and managing containers.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for consistent provisioning.
- **Flux**: Implementing GitOps for continuous delivery.
- **Azure Key Vault**: Managing secrets securely.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Handling backups and data persistence.

## Future Goals

This homelab is a dynamic project, and my future plans include:

- Experimenting with **Kubernetes Operators** for database management.
- Deploying self-hosted applications to simulate real-world scenarios.
- Learning and applying advanced networking concepts within Kubernetes.
- Integrating CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.
- Exploring hybrid cloud setups by integrating local VMs with Azure resources.
